					Scrum is not a methodology but a framework ("easy to learn") that will not deliver on its promise unless it is exercised with its core values ("hard to do").
					It helps generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems, it also optimize predictibility and control risk.
					
				</p>

				<p>Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills to turn the user stories to valuable increments. It has four events within a containing event, the Sprint. </p>
				<p>These events can only work efficiently when they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.</p>

				<p>
					Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
				</p>	
					<ol>
						<li>A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.</li>
						<li>The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an increment of value during a Sprint.</li>
						<li>The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.</li>
						<li>Repeat</li>

				<h2>Transparency</h2>
				<p>
					The work and process must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. Low transparency will lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk. <code>Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.</code></p>

				<h2>Inspection</h2>
				<p>
					The progress toward agreed goal must be inspected frequently to detect undesirable problems.
					Scrum provokes to change, <code>Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless.</code>
				</p>

				<h2>Adaptation</h2>
				<p>
					Adaptation becomes difficult when team is not empowered or self-managing. Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

			<header>Scrum Values</header>
			<article>
				<p>When the values <code>Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage</code> are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone.</p>

				<p>These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values, not undermine them. The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.</p>

			<header>Scrum Team</header>
			<article>
				<p>The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people. The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. There are no sub-teams or hierarchies. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, they have all the skills needed to create value each Sprint. They are self-managing, they decide who does what, when, and how.</p>
				<p>
					The Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in 
				</p>

				<h2>Developers</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are commited to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Developers are always accountable for:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog</li>
						<li>Instilling quality by adhering to a Definiton of Done</li>
						<li>Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal</li>
						<li>Holding each other accountable as professionals.</li>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<h2>Product Owner</h2>
				<article>
					<p>The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Those wanting to change the Product backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product owner.</p>

					<p>
						The Products Owner's challenging task is to act as the interface between the upper management functions and the team level. Product Owner is responsible for creating clarity for the teams as to what the clients or stakeholders want.
					</p>

					<p>
						Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which inclueds;
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal</li>
						<li>Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items</li>
						<li>Ordering Product Backlog items</li>
						<li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.</li>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<h2>Scrum Master</h2>
				<article>
					<p>Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.</p>

					<p>
						The Scrum Master is accountable for effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.
					</p>
					<code>Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.</code>
					<p>
						The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality</li>
						<li>Helping the team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done</li>
						<li>Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team's progress</li>
						<li>Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management</li>
						<li>Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment</li>
						<li>Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption</li>
						<li>Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization</li>
						<li>Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.</li>

			<header>Scrum Events</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					The Sprint is a container for all other events. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.
					Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt. All events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.
				</p>
				<h2>The Sprint</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value. They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
					</p>

					<p>
						All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.
					</p>

					<p>During the Sprint:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>No changes are made that would endangered the Sprint Goal</li>
						<li>Quality does not decrease</li>
						<li>The Product Backlog is refined as needed</li>
						<li>Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Sprints enable predictibilty by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calender month. Short Sprints can be emoloyed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame. Each Sprint may be considered a short project.</p>
				</article>

				<h2>Sprint Planning</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						Sprint Planning is initiates the Sprint by lying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborarive work of the entire Scrum Team.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:
					</p>

					<h4>1: Why is this Spring valuable></h4>
					<p>The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.</p>

					<h4>2: What can be Done this Sprint?</h4>
					
					<p>
						Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
					</p>

					<p>
						Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.
					</p>

					<h4>3: How will the chosen work get done?</h4>

					<p>
						For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.
					</p>

					<p>Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.</p>
				</article>

				<h2>Daily Scrum</h2>
				<article>
					<p>The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress towar the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.</p>

					<p>Time duration for a Daily Scrum is 15-minute for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.</p>

					<p>Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal.</p>

					<p>Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings. </p>
					<code>They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work. </code>
				</article>

				<h2>Sprint Review</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						During a Sprint Review the team puts the result of its work under the spotlight for stakeholders to provide feedback. The team should present the Increment and review the backlog with transparency. Stakeholders have to provide honest feedback. Without this the benefit of Inspection and Adaptation fades.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
					</p>
				</article>

				<h2>Sprint Retrospective</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

		<section class="main-section" id="Scrum_Artifacts">
			<header>Scrum Artifacts</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.</li>
					<li>For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.</li>
					<li>For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Product Backlog</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.
					</p>

					<h4>Commitment: Product Goal</h4>
					<article>
						<p>The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.</p>

						<p>The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next</p>
					</article>
				</article>

				<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>
				<article>
					<p>
						The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).
					</p>

					<p>
						The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.
					</p>

					<h4>Commitment: Sprint Goal</h4>
					<article>
						<p>
							The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.

			<header>Definition of Done</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration. 
				</p>

				<p>
					If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
